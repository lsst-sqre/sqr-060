Summary
=======

Semaphore is a service that provides user messaging services for Rubin Science Platform (RSP).
The initial launch of Semaphore focuses on broadcast-type messages that are shown to all RSP users.
This system leverages GitHub as a content management system in conjunction with the Sempahore API service itself and client-facing UIs that are embedded in applications such as Squareone (science platform homepage).
This technical note describes the data model and functionality of Semaphore broadcast messaging.
